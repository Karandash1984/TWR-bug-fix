 twriraq.0.t:0 "The Hashemite Kindom of Iraq in 1952 - The Road Not Taken"
 twriraq.0.d:0 "Sitting in the ancient region of Mesopotamia, the 'Cradle of Civilisation', Iraq is an Arab Hashemite kingdom, established following the 1920 Iraqi Revolt from the ruins of the fallen Ottoman Empire. Initially ruled directly as a British mandate, Iraq gained its official independence in 1932 following years of negotiations and diplomacy, though the British retained significant influence in the country's economy. When Britain declared war on Nazi Germany in 1939, dissent began to bubble in the young kingdom, as the Anglo-Axis war seemed to provide the chance for Iraq to free itself from British domination. This was not to be, however, as spectacular defeat of the Anglo-French forces in Europe led to the surrender of France and the Anglo-German Armistice of 1940. Groups such as the Golden Square, that had been plotting a revolt, now found themselves vulnerable, and a crackdown by the regent's loyalists combined with concessions to the Iraqi population drove the group underground, at least for the time being.\n\nHowever, one revolt prevented does not save a waning Empire. The weakness of Britain was shown for all the world to see, with its humiliating deescalation with Germany causing the illusion of an invincible power to shatter. Watching nations such as India break free, dissent has again bubbled up, and while under control for now by the Regent and his British backers, revolutionary and reformist forces, with much to divide them but united in opposition to Abd al-Ilah and his Anglo-American 'overlords', swirl beneath the surface, inspired by the extraordinary success of the European fascist movements.\n\nNobody knows what the future will bring for Iraq and whether the not the young King will live to see the throne, but many question whether the old 'protector' of Middle Eastern order in London now has the strength to maintain the status quo. Some radical solutions have been floated, including strengthening the country by working with its Hashemite partners in Jordan, but what is almost certain is that there will be much change in the region in the near future, and Iraq risks getting caught in the sandstorm."
 twriraq.0.a:0 "An interesting time for Iraq."
 # diplomacy
 twriraq.1.t:0 "Federation with Jordan?"
 twriraq.1.d:0 "The rise of the new Egyptian government under Sadat has sent shockwaves throughout the Middle East, and with the recent formation of the United Arab States, many people believe that the future security of the Kingdom of Iraq is under threat. Our allies in Jordan, similarly ruled by a Hashemite monarchy, are in a similar position, and as a result, many have proposed a Union between our two nations, once again reclaiming the Hashemites' spot as the champions of pan-Arab unity.\n\nUnder the proposal, Iraq and Jordan would unite into a loose confederation, the Hashemite Arab Federation. Both states would mostly continue to rule themselves, but in foreign policy and militarily, we would be united.\n\nShould we go ahead with this proposal, the King of Jordan would have to accept as well, who we have been negotiating with for some time. Shall we send the proposal officially?"
 twriraq.1.a:0 "The time has come to realize Faisal's dream."
 twriraq.1.b:0 "We're better off alone."
 twriraq.2.t:0 "Federation with Iraq?"
 twriraq.2.d:0 "An interesting proposal has arrived at the court of our King - a Union with the Kingdom of Iraq. Iraq, ruled by another Hashemite monarchy like ours, is proposing that, in the face of the military failure against Israel, and common risks of political instability, we must unite our two kingdoms under one loose Federation.\n\nWhile this would be advantageous for our nation's security, we would be absorbed by a much larger Iraqi nation. Shall we accept?"
 twriraq.2.a:0 "Our people shall be united!"
 twriraq.2.b:0 "We're better off alone."
 twriraq.3.t:0 "Birth of the Hashemite Arab Federation"
 twriraq.3.d.a:0 "With the enthusiastic support of King Abdullah of Jordan, an official proposal for a union between our two Hashemite monarchies has been signed. With his status as the eldest surviving son of the late Sharif Hussein, the patriarch of the Hashemite dynasty, King Abdullah has been crowned the "King of The Arabs" in a grand ceremony in Baghdad.\n\nBroadcasted across the Arab world and attended by dignitaries from across the Middle East, the creation of the Hashemite Arab Federation has proven to the world that the Hashemites are still the rightful champions of Arab nationalism, with the new Federation promising to lead the Arab world into a new era of unity and strength against those revolutionaries who threaten our established order and traditions."
 twriraq.3.d.b:0 "With the enthusiastic support of King [JOR.GetLeader] of Jordan, an official proposal for a union between our two Hashemite monarchies has been signed. With the death of King Abdullah, the Hashmite dynasty is lacking any single unifying figure to be declared the new federation's king. As such, a dual monarchy has been established between King Faisal II of Iraq and King [JOR.GetLeader] of Jordan.\n\nBroadcasted across the Arab world and attended by dignitaries from across the Middle East, the creation of the Hashemite Arab Federation has proven to the world that the Hashemites are still the rightful champions of Arab nationalism, with the new Federation promising to lead the Arab world into a new era of unity and strength against those revolutionaries who threaten our established order and traditions."
 twriraq.3.a:0 "Long live the Federation!"
 twriraq.4.t:0 "Jordan Refuses"
 twriraq.4.d:0 "Wow. That's crazy. I honestly don't know what to write here."
 twriraq.4.a:0 "Why the hell would someone play Jordan?"

 # political
 twriraq.5.t:0 "Civil Unrest"
 twriraq.5.d:0 "Forces hostile to the Kingdom and its perceived western backers have existed and grown strong in Iraq ever since the nation gained independence. Now, however, that opposition is beginning to boil over into unrest. Parties and opposition groups recruit in the shadows, as manifestos and dissenting voices are heard in the streets. Ideas of rebellion are spreading among much of the population."
 twriraq.5.a:0 "Worrying"
 twriraq.6.t:0 "Revolution in Baghdad"
 twriraq.6.d:0 "Riding off the back of anti-monarchist sentiment following the nation's defeat in the Arab-Israeli war, opposition groups have decided that public opposition towards the monarchy has reached a level high enough for a coup to be attempted. Earlier today, armies under generals of the Golden Square launched a revolution against the monarchist government, storming the al-Rahab Palace without facing any major resistance with King Faisal II along with many of his closest supporters being executed, with their bodies being paraded across the streets of the city.\n\nA new era has dawned upon Iraq, and the old order has been destroyed forever."
 twriraq.6.a:0 "The coup is foiled"
 twriraq.6.b:0 "Down with the King!"
 twriraq.6.a1:0 "The coup is foiled"
 twriraq.6.b1:0 "Down with the King!"
 twriraq.7.t:0 "The Golden Square"
 twriraq.7.d:0 "As the chaos of the recent coup and the creation of the young Republic continues, another group lurks in the shadows, about to pounce. Calling themselves the Golden Square, they are a group of pro-Axis officers who plotted to overthrow the government during the Anglo-Axis war but were forced to go back underground after the Anglo-German armistice and the British crackdown. Now, emboldened by the chaos that has hit the country, they see a chance to seize power once and for all."
 twriraq.7.a:0 "Golden Square seizes power"
 twriraq.7.b:0 "They are foiled... again."
 twriraq.8.t:0 "Covert Action in Baghdad"
 twriraq.8.d:0 "Recent events in Baghdad are very worrying. After the recent Republican revolution, a group of explicitly pro-Axis officers calling themselves 'The Golden Square' have seized power in the country. It seems very likely that they will pursue an actively pro-German and Italian foreign policy, putting the Middle East in grave danger.\n\nWhile an invasion at this time may be even more destabilising, the CIA may be able to support a removal of them from power by supporting other groups. A restoration of the monarchy is virtually impossible with the King having been executed, but the possibilty of supporting the Arab Socialist Union, a powerful and popular faction in the the country, has been proposed. With our support, they could come to power. Left-wing Arab nationalists may not be our most preferably ally, but surely better to have them than those who would work with the fascists?"
 twriraq.8.a:0 "Support a socialist coup."
 twriraq.8.b:0 "It's too risky."
 twriraq.9.t.a:0 "Arab Socialist Union Coup"
 twriraq.9.d.a:0 "It would appear that the recent power struggle in the nation has finally ended. Earlier today, tank units loyal to Arab Socialist leader Abdul Salam Arif rolled through Baghdad, taking the Qasim government by suprise. Capturing key radio stations and military bases early on in the day, the pro-Qasim forces were overwhelmed and disorganized, allowing for them to easily be mopped up by sunset.\n\nAnnouncing the coup on the radio, Abdul Salam Arif has declared the formation of a new government led by the ASU. Qasim was executed under the orders of the newly-formed National Council of the Revolutionary Command, with further purges of Golden Square and al-Muthanna officials taking place."
 twriraq.9.t.b:0 "Failed Socialist Coup"
 twriraq.9.d.b:0 "It would appear that the recent power struggle in the nation has finally ended. Earlier today, tank units loyal to Socialist leader Abdul Salam Arif attempted to roll through Baghdad, but they proved to be disorganized and were quickly overwhelmed by pro-Qasim forces. Qasim has announced the failure of the coup on national radio, declaring that the socialists must be purged for their crimes against the Iraqi nation.\n\nWith this victory, it would appear that the Qasim and his Golden Square have launched a purge of all opposition, cementing their rule."
 twriraq.9.a:0 "Revolution!"
 twriraq.9.b:0 "The socialists have proven their betrayal!"
 twriraq.10.t:0 "Power Struggle Begins"
 twriraq.10.d:0 "With the government consolidated following the revolution, and remnants of the old kingdom purged from society, a new power struggle has emerged between the socialist and fascists in the unity government. On one side, the fascist al-Muthanna Club, led by Rashid Ali Al-Gaylani and supported by members of the Golden Square, has pushed for Iraq to align itself with the nations of the Axis in a hardline stance against British influence across the Middle East. On the other side, the Arab Socialist Union, led by Fuad al-Rikabi and Abdul Salam Arif, while not completely against cooperation with the Axis, supports a more pragmatic international policy, taking lessons from events such as the revolution in India.\n\nWith the Golden Square controlling most of the government and the military, many believe that the socialists do not stand a chance, but with Germany in chaos and foreign powers eyeing the new Iraqi republic, it is anyone's game."
 twriraq.10.a:0 "Brace..."
 twriraq.11.t:0 "Rumours of CIA Involvement"
 twriraq.11.d:0 "With the power struggle between al-Muthanna and the Arab Socialist Union ongoing, it has been rumoured that the CIA has been involving themselves with ASU activities. With it seeming very likely that the al-Muthanna Club and the Golden Square will pursue an actively pro-German and Italian foreign policy, putting the Middle East in grave danger, rumours have spread of CIA activity in support of the socialists, who while not the west's most preferred ally, will not actively align the country toward Axis interests."
 twriraq.11.a:0 "Nothing but blatant lies!"
 twriraq.11.b:0 "This should be investigated!"

 twriraq.12.t:0 "Elections"
 twriraq.12.d:0 "Across the country, the second nationwide Parliamentary elections since the Intifada and the Arab-Israeli war. This time, however, anticipation and political activity is higher than ever, after initial political reforms and promises of an unprecedentedly free election. People are enthusiastically turning out to vote, and for the most part we have allowed them the freedom to do so without state interference. There is still a guiding hand, with the more radical parties being sidelined and a 'National Bloc' sponsored by Nuri Al Said are ready to win on a national conservative, Arab nationalist platform, but given the newfound freedom of the electorage, there rumors that the Liberals will make major gains and be the ones to form a government this time."
 twriraq.12.a:0 "Nuri al-Said carries the CUP to victory."
 twriraq.12.b:0 "Muhammad Al Jamali manages to consolidate a liberal cabinet."
 twriraq.13.t:0 "The Road to Reform"
 twriraq.13.d:0 "The authoritarian system with a thin veneer of democracy that has run our country since our independence has failed. Recent events have shown that if the monarchy and the Iraqi Kingdom is to survive, it must reform, making changes, allowing freedoms, and giving concessions to the people. Only in this way can our nation be preserved from radicalism."
 twriraq.13.a:0 "It's time for change"
 twriraq.14.t:0 "Revising the Constitution"
 twriraq.14.d:0 "The cornerstone of our new wave of reforms must be a shift in the laws by which we govern. By revising the original 1925 constitution, we can guarantee the rights of the people and parliament, while also clarifying the central role of the Monarchy and his advisors as a mediating force within the nation. This will both placate those calling for change, as well as securing the position of our state and the power of those close to the King."
 twriraq.14.a:0 "Update the constitution!"
 twriraq.15.t:0 "The Royal Tour"
 twriraq.15.d:0 "Though he is still virtually a child, King Faisal's ministers have persuaded him to embark on a tour of the kingdom, visiting the people and hopefully winning back their confidence. Recent unrest has clearly shown that many in the country resent the monarchy and its insitutions, which represents a clear threat to the Iraqi state. This cannot be allowed to continue, and every effort must be made to improve the imagine of the monarchy and everything it represents in the eyes of the population."
 twriraq.15.a:0 "To the people!"
 twriraq.16.t:0 "Parliament Desolved"
 twriraq.16.d:0 "With the recent massive wave of instability, the King, on advice of his ministers, has dissolved the Iraqi Parliament for the time being, 'until such a time as when order can be restored'. Members were barred from entering and what democracy there is in the country has been indefinitely suspended."
 twriraq.16.a:0 "We must remove distractions"
 twriraq.17.t:0 "War against Saudi Arabia"
 twriraq.17.d:0 "No single Arab state stands against the unification of the Arab people under one Arab nationalist and socialist flag as Saudi Arabia. Building huge wealth from its vast oil resources, the vast Saudi royal family promotes a backwards monarchist system based on extreme religious fanatacism, while they betray their people by working with foreign imperialist powers.\n\nWhile preparations for an attack have been long-standing, and many in our government believe that this insult of a nation must be smashed immediately through force, others say this is too dangerous and could risk foreign intervention. What shall we do?"
 twriraq.17.a:0 "Attack!"
 twriraq.17.b:0 "Bide our time..."
 twriraq.18.t:0 "Seize Jordan"
 twriraq.18.d:0 "Now that we have overthrown our own Hashemite monarchy, many are pushing for us to destroy the other, in Jordan. Not only will this remove a threat to our new Republic and increase its power, but others say our country is not ready for war. How shall we proceed?"
 twriraq.18.a:0 "Attack!"
 twriraq.18.b:0 "Bide our time..."
 twriraq.19.t:0 "Create the Arab Nation"
 twriraq.19.d:0 "With our armies victorious, we can finally begin the process of uniting the Arab peoples. Now, we can declare the Arab State!"
 twriraq.19.a:0 "Arabs United!"
 twriraq.20.t:0 "Our Ties With the Axis"
 twriraq.20.d:0 "Now that we have established our new government, we must begin the task of ridding ourselves and the Middle East of British and American influence. For this task, our natural allies are those that destroyed the French and beat the British, the victorious Axis powers. However, tensions between Germany and Italy have risen in the past years, and while we will attempt to build positive relations with both, we must chose which bloc to prioritise in aligning with.\n\nOn one hand, the German Reich controls and dominates most of Europe. It was they who beat our sworn enemy and oppressor, the British Empire, into defeat and humiliation. However, Germany is far away, and might not be in the best position to aid us.\n\nOn the other hand, Italy has challenged the British in the Middle East ever since the end of the European War. Since then, they created the Mediterranean Pact as a new alliance of states around the Mediterranean under their guidance. While some argue Italian imperialists are no better than the British, perhaps they could support us more directly due to their influence over the Mediterranean and the Arab World."
 twriraq.20.a:0 "We should align with Germany."
 twriraq.20.b:0 "Italy is a safer bet."
 twriraq.21.t:0 "Iraq Approaches Us"
 twriraq.21.d:0 "Following the revolution in Iraq, the new nationalist government has decided to extend its hand to us in an attempt to cooperate against our shared enemies in the Middle East."
 twriraq.21.a:0 "More allies are always welcome."
 twriraq.22.t:0 "Joining Italy?"
 twriraq.22.d:0 "Italy has challenged the British in the Middle East ever since the short European war of 1939-40. Since then, they created the Mediterranean Pact as a new alliance of states around the Mediterranean under their guidance. While some argue Italian imperialists are no better than the British, perhaps we would be advantaged and rewarded by joining their alliance and thus breaking free of Anglo-American influence completely."
 twriraq.22.a:0 "Ask to join"
 twriraq.22.b:0 "European imperialists are all the same"
 twriraq.23.t:0 "Iraq Requests to join Med. Pact"
 twriraq.23.d:0 "The new 'Golden Square' government in Iraq, declaring that it will do anything to rid itself and the Middle East of Anglo-American influence, has approached us by requesting entry into the Mediterranean Pact. This would undoubtably expand our influence in the Middle East, but it could lead to heightened tensions and possible confrontation with the British and their American allies. How shall we respond?"
 twriraq.23.a:0 "Accept them"
 twriraq.23.b:0 "They're not worth the trouble"
 twriraq.24.t:0 "Italy Refuses"
 twriraq.24.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Italians have refused our application to the Mediterranean Pact. It seems we must forge a path alone."
 twriraq.24.a:0 "What a shame"
 twriraq.25.t:0 "Seizing Kuwait"
 twriraq.25.d:0 "Ever since our farce "Independence" in 1930, there has been no greater symbol of British oppression of Iraq than Kuwait. Not only is it a rightful part of the Iraqi nation, but it also represents Britain's base in Mesopotamia, from which their dominance of the region is achieved. If we are to achieve true freedom, many say, Kuwait must be taken by force of arms.\n\nThe decision has been made. Our armies are ready to march, determined to liberate the Arab world from British domination. Personally speaking to the troops in Basra, Prime Minister [IRQ.GetLeader] has promised them that this will be the great victory that will cement their place in history. The eyes of the oppressed Arab world are upon us! We must march!"
 twriraq.25.a:0 "To victory!"
 twriraq.26.t:0 "Iraq Seizes Kuwait"
 twriraq.26.d.a:0 "Shocking news from the Middle East - in our time of weakness, Iraq has seized our territory of Kuwait through force of arms, declaring it an integral part of the Iraqi nation. The revolution of the 'Golden Square' years ago had set off alarm bells almost immediately, and it seems such alarm was right.\n\nWith Kuwait now under Iraqi control, it seems that our influence in the region is now seriously threatened. This act of aggression cannot be tolerated, doubly so with Iraq's friendliness towards the Axis powers. Despite this, in our weakened state, we must choose our reaction carefully. While a direct invasion of Iraq is not out of the question, we might have more success commencing some sort of joint operation with our Middle Eastern allies such as Egypt. Whatever we do, we must act quickly."

Whatever we do, we must act quickly."
 twriraq.26.a:0 "Contact our allies in the region."
 twriraq.27.t:0 "Western Sanctions"
 twriraq.27.d:0 "Britain and America, it seems, were too weak to go to war over Kuwait, and it seems our rule in the region is now secure. Instead, however, they have placed sanctions on our country, which will impact our economy. A price to be sure, but one that is worth the reward."
 twriraq.27.a:0 "Cowards!"

 twriraq.28.t:0 "Victory in Iran"
 twriraq.28.d:0 "Our forces have succeeded against the Persians, and now comes our chance to end the war. We can seize the lands across the border, including the Arab-majority and oil-rich region of Khuzestan, which we claimed."
 twriraq.28.a:0 "Send the demands"
 twriraq.29.t:0 "Defeat"
 twriraq.29.d:0 "Our forces have been comprehensively defeated by the Arab invaders. We have been pushed back, and our populace refuses to continue fighting. With such a disaster, we have no choice but to accept their peace terms, ceding the border regions in the west of our country including the oil-rich and Arab-majority region of Khuzestan.\n\nFor now, this is a disaster for Iran. We can only hope we can reclaim these lands in the future."
 twriraq.29.a:0 "A bitter peace."
 twriraq.29.b:0 "No peace for the Arabs!"
 twriraq.30.t:0 "Iran Accepts"

 twriraq.291.d:0 "Our forces have been comprehensively defeated by the Iranian counterattack. We have been pushed back, and our populace refuses to continue fighting. With such a disaster, we have no choice but to accept their peace terms, dashing our hope of reclaiming the Arab-majority region of Khuzestan.\n\nFor now, this is a disaster for Iraq. We can only hope we can reclaim these lands in the future."
 twriraq.291.a:0 "A bitter peace."
 twriraq.301.t:0 "Iraq Surrenders"

 ###
 twriraq.34.t:0 "Kurds Resist"
 twriraq.34.d:0 "Our policies of suppressing Kurdish culture and freedom in favour of an Arab-centric state has, as expected, created increased resistance and resentment. Protests are being held across the Kurdish regions in the north of the country, and even armed rebellion is breaking out against our forces.\n\nHowever, we must remain steadfast. Only through forcing these policies through and crushing any resistance can we stabilise our country and remove secessionist elements."
 twriraq.34.a:0 "Fight them!"

 twriraq.35.t:0 "The Arab State"
 twriraq.35.d:0 "With our seizure of Jordan, we have begun on the road towards Arab unification. No longer are we simply an Iraqi Republic, we will from now on be known as an Arab state!"

 twriraq.36.t:0 "King Faisal's Coronation"
 twriraq.36.d:0 "Ever since the death of his father in 1939, Iraq has been ruled by the late king Ghazi's brother-in-law, Abd al-Ilah, who has served as regent for Ghazi's young son. Now, with young Faisal II coming of age, the Regent has stepped down, making way for the young heir to take the throne.\n\nAs Faisal II inherits his father's mantle, he also inherits a nation which contains many groups that oppose his rule, and the stability of the Kingdom is in danger. Today, however, for Faisal and the Iraq monarchy, there is a jubilant mood."
 twriraq.36.a:0 "Long Live the King!"

 twriraq.37.t:0 "King Faisal's Wedding"
 twriraq.37.d:0 "Ever since the death of his mother in 1950, the aunts of his majesty have been looking for a suitable Queen for him, they landed on two Candidates. The first is Princess Shahnaz of Iran, firstborn of the Shah of Iran. Alternatively, there is also Egyptian Princess Fazila Muhammad Ali, a cousin of King Farouk. But just incase those matches don't stick, there is Princess Kiymet Hanım, a descendant of the Mamluk dynasty of Iraq."

 twriraq.38.d:0 "Following the Great War, Prince Faisal I, who would later become the king of Iraq, ruled over Syria for a short time until the nation was conquered by the French. Despite this, even after thirty years of French rule which have now ended, the people of Syria still yearn to unite with their Arab bretheren in Jordan and Iraq, as seen with the pro-Hashemite People's Party's triumph in the nation.\n\nWith the rise of extremist forces threatening the stability and order of the Arab World, Syria must stand united with our brothers in the Hashemite Arab Federation. Together, we will achieve our pan-Arab destiny!"

Despite this, even after thirty years of French rule which have now ended, the people of Syria still yearn to unite with their Arab bretheren in Jordan and Iraq.\n\nWith the rise of extremist forces threatening the stability and order of the Arab World, the pro-Hashemite government of Nazim al-Qudsi and the People's Party have approached us with a a request to join the Hashemite Arab Federation.

 twriraq.41.a:0 "A disaster!"

 twriraq.42.t:0 "Farhud"
 twriraq.42.d:0 "When dawn broke on Baghdad the day after the revolution, the people were wide awake. With the fires of the previous day's battles still burning, and the streets smelling of gunpowder and bodies, not many could tell you where the first glass was broken or when the first firebomb was thrown. All that could be said about the events of the day was the screams heard across the city.\n\nThe mutilations, the rapes, the beatings and the beheadings, all would live forever in the minds of those who were lucky enough to only have observed them. The small amount of police who did not join in in the riots were completely overwhelmed, blindly firing machine guns into crowds of rioters and bystanders alike.\n\nAll this was not as terrifying as the dawn of the day after. The city was quiet. What had happened to the people responsible? What was to happen to the survivors?\n\nThe quiet of the next day was much more terrifying than any events of the day before."
 twriraq.42.a:0 "Allahu Akbar!"
 twriraq.42.b:0 "Allahu Akbar..."

 twriraq.43.t:0 "Farhud"
 twriraq.43.d:0 "[THIS.GetNewspaperHeader]When dawn broke on Baghdad on the day following the revolution, the people of the city had already been awaken by the sounds of broken glass and firebombs. With a complete collapse of order in the city following the events of the previous day, thousands of rioters stormed the Jewish neighborhoods of Baghdad. Jewish homes and businesses were burned down while their occupants, accused of being spies for Israel, were dragged onto the streets and beaten to death with clubs, with their bodies being mutilated and strung around the city.\n\nThe small amount of police who did not join the riots were completely overwhelmed, blindly firing machine guns into crowds of rioters and bystanders alike. Rumours place the total death count in the hundreds if not thousands."
 twriraq.43.a:0 "My god..."

 twriraq.44.t:0 "Al Said Replaced"
 twriraq.44.d:0 "The elder statesman Nuri al-Said has dominated Iraqi parliamentary politics since the 1930s, but now it seems his long career at the top is coming to an end. Following the recent developments, large proportions of the Iraqi population have lost confidence in the man, seeing him increasingly as overly deferential towards the British and a conservative unsuited to changing times, and even many of his former allies in Parliament and the monarchy have decided that he has outlived his immediate usefulness. In his place, the longtime Minister of the Interior Mustafa Mahmud al-Umari will be appointed as the new Prime Minister. Though he does not represent significant political change, it is hoped he will be a fresh face that is more palatable to the people."
 twriraq.44.a:0 "We hope he does better."

 twriraq.45.t:0 "The Intifada Begins"
 twriraq.45.d:0 "For some time, dissatisfaction has bubbled against the Hashemite dynasty and the Iraqi government. Despite economic growth, living conditions for much of the poor of society have failed to improve significantly, and many are angry at what they see as political stagnation. Most of all, frustration has long existed against the meddling of the British, and despite small steps towards independence, many still see their nation as a vassal to London. The monarchy and government, seemingly willing participants of this arrangement, have only suffered in terms of their appeal.\n\nIt began with isolated strikes among port workers in Basra, followed by increasing agitation by radical groups such as the Communist Party. Now, a larger series of protests and strikes is spreading across the country, a great 'Intifada', or uprising, against the government by the dissatisfied masses, inspired by their comrades across the Middle East. The nation is being rocked to its core by this wave of political instability, and the continued stability, or even existence, of the Kingdom is at stake."

 twriraq.46.d:0 "In an effort to restore some stability and confidence in the government, it has been decided that Nureddin Mahmud will be appointed as the new Prime Minister. Following consultation with his political allies and the British, the regent decided that a military government was the only way to restore stability. Despite the increasing unpopularity of the monarchy and parliament, the military as an institution has largely maintained the respect and support of the people, being seen as a unifying national organisation. Lieutenant General of the Iraqi Army Nureddin Mahmud thus has the potential to be both a popular and ruthless figure able to steer the government through this crisis, and being strongly loyal towards the Hashemite dynasty, we can count on his continued allegiance."
 twriraq.46.a:0 "We'll see."

 twriraq.47.t:0 "1953 Elections"
 twriraq.47.d:0 "Following the curbing of recent political turmoil, elections have been quickly organised to bring stability and normal process back to Iraqi politics. With the votes having been counted, there have been no surprises - the Constitutional Union Party, which has dominated politics since its foundation in 1949, has won a majority of seats in Parliament, with Jamil Al Midfai to be appointed Prime Minister. While outside observers, and the mocking rumours of many Iraqis, have painted the election as not entirely fair, for now it has served its purpose in restoring some stability." 
 twriraq.47.a:0 "Back to normal."

 twriraq.48.t:0 "A New Prime Minister"
 twriraq.48.d:0 "As part of the young King Faisal's broader effort to take Iraq in a new, more reformist political direction, Muhammad Fadhel al-Jamali has been appointed Prime Minister, replacing Jamil Al Midfai.\n\nA longtime Minister of Foreign Affairs, al-Jamali has gained a reputation for being a potential reformist. Born into a conservative Shi'ite family and initially enrolled into a conservative religious education, al-Jamali studied in Beirut, Baghdad and Columbia University in the United States, publishing a Doctorate Thesis on 'New Iraq'. Since then, he has been an outspoken Arab nationalist, supportive of all Arab independence movements, and calling for Arab unity over religious or tribal sectarianism, while maintaining a generally pro-western outlook. It is hoped by many that al-Jamali's appointment signals a shift to further development of Iraq's democracy, and his appointment of a cabinet of young officials consisting of Sunni, Shia and Kurdish members seems a positive sign, though only time will tell how far this comes to be."
 twriraq.48.a:0 "A new direction."

 twriraq.49.t:0 "Military Budget Question"
 twriraq.49.d:0 "In the wake of recent instability, it seems the military brass have taken advantage of the weakness of our government and their strength in this situation to make their own demands. In not so subtle terms, top generals have requested, or rather demanded, a commitment to increasing the military budget, according to them, to safeguard the country's security and as compensation for the army's help in these trying times. This puts us in a rather difficult position. Increasing the military budget would of course strengthen our armed forces and, perhaps more importantly, keep the military on side, but it would be expensive. With much of our budget having already been spent on other projects and promises to appease the masses, this would put a strain on our treasury. On the other hand, simply refusing the military's demands would be risky. While we do not believe they would turn against us entirely, such an important part of our state and security system seeing wavering loyalties could become very dangerous if there were to be another similar crisis."

No longer a puppet of the British Empire, we are now free to chart our own course in the world, and it seems that many nations are to form relations with the new government. If we are to achieve our dream of a united Arab state, we must try and court the support of one of the great power blocs.\n\nOn one hand, the United States and the rest of the Toronto Accord have expressed their interest in reconciling with our government, and it seems that they are willing to offer us aid and support in exchange for our alignment with them. However, many in our government are wary of falling under the influence of the West once again, considering that our government only came to power after the toppling of the British-backed monarchy.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the Axis powers, who remain the dominant force in Europe and have long expressed their interest in expanding their influence in the Middle East. While some in our government are wary of aligning with fascists, others see them as a natural ally against the British and Americans, who have long oppressed the Arab people, even claiming that our nationalist outlooks are actually aligned with those of the Germans. However, aligning with the Axis could risk alienating us from the rest of the world and could further enflame tensions with the West.\n\nLastly, there is the option of aligning with the new revolutionary India. Having recently thrown off the shackles of British rule, India is a natural ally for us, and many see them as the leader of the global anti-imperialist movement. However, India is a relatively weak power compared to the alternatives, and alignment with them would not bring nearly as much benefits as the other options.\n\nOur available choices will certainly be affected by the current international situation, and with the fate of the Middle East hanging in the balance, we must choose wisely."

Citing systematic weaknesses within the Iraqi army, particularly the lack of cooperativeness, conservatism and resistance to reform of its command, Robertson's indictment concluded that Iraq could be of little to no help in defending British interests in the event of an invasion of the Middle East by a major power like Germany or Italy, ultimately recommending against significant efforts at strategic cooperation as essentially pointless.\n\nClearly, if we are to achieve genuine military independence and usefulness, we must show our allies that this damning report is no longer true, and that means reflecting on the problems it identified and working to fix them. We cannot let our allies abandon us as useless, we must show we are able to hold our own - the future of Iraq depends on it."

While many revolutions in the past have eaten themselves, we are determined for unity among the revolutionaries to hold.

Radical socialists and fascists, united only in their opposition to the old regime, have grown increasingly visibly apart and are retreating into their own political blocs, as instability within the revolutionary government spikes. This can only end in violence, one way or another."

Many see it merely as a social club for officers of sorts. However the truth is, this \"social club\" is a clique of military officers who admire and aspire to follow in the footsteps Nazi Germany and the Italian Empire. Now they have amassed enough support within the military to seize control of the government in the midst of the revolution. Iraq, it seems, is following the jackboot of much of Europe..."

 IRQ_Reform:0 "Reform"
 IRQ_Reform_desc:0 "If we are to prevent our people from rising up and dragging us through the streets, the monarchy must reform immediately. The British monarchy has survived by relinquishing much of its powers to a legislative body, turning itself into a symbolic figurehead institution above the sway of party politics.

A key factor in the Socialists' widespread popular support during the revolution was our promise to enact sweeping reforms and social projects to help the poorest of Iraq.

 IRQ_State_Controlled_Economy:0 "State-Controlled Economy"
 IRQ_State_Controlled_Economy_desc:0 "Iraq's economy is mostly focused on agricultural goods and oil exports, which give us much theoretical wealth, but has failed to prosper for the people. The British have always skimmed their share of the wealth. Even worse, local mismanagement, or lack of management altogether, from the monarchy has led to Iraq's economy slipping stagnating and failing to make use of its resources. Only a huge intervention from our government will allow our economy to grow and prosper.

Still resentful over their lack of gains, Italy may be very interested in an alliance with us against a common enemy in the British Empire.

The British have always had their claws in the middle east, especially Iraq, but now they are growing weak, having faced defeats from the rising powers of Europe in recent times. Enough is enough.

 IRQ_Promote_Iraq_Unity:0 "Promote Iraqi Unity"
 IRQ_Promote_Iraq_Unity_desc:0 "Since the earliest days of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq has been a difficult region to control. The Arab people are a naturally unruly people, and the lands of Iraq are divided into many groups of different sects and creeds, but if we are to become a modern nation, the people must work as a collective. A massive propaganda campaign shall be ignited, promoting the idea of a common Iraqi national identity and denouncing separatism and sectarianism of all kinds, while school curricula are changed to reflect this. Our nation will see strength through unity!"
 IRQ_Road_To_Reform:0 "The Road to Reform"
 IRQ_Road_To_Reform_desc:0 "The road to reform will be a difficult one. The entrenched elite of Iraq is riddled with hardliners who oppose all reform, while political radicals reject it, seeing it as a cynical diversion. The country will not be served either by reaction, nor by revolution however. We must set out, formalise and begin pushing through our plans for political reform, using the spirit of compromise and pragmatism to chart the way forward."
 IRQ_Hunt_Down_Traitors:0 "Hunt Down the Traitors"
 IRQ_Hunt_Down_Traitors_desc:0 "No stone shall be left unturned in the quest to save Iraq from traitors and revolutionaries. All traitors to the state must be hunted down and destroyed.

 IRQ_Political_Freedoms_desc:0 "Iraq's people have never truly been the masters of their own destiny. To pave the way for Iraq's first true election in its history, the civil restrictions on our people must be relaxed.

 IRQ_Cut_Down_Corruption:0 "Stamp Out Corruption"
 IRQ_Cut_Down_Corruption_desc:0 "From the bureaucracy, the military, the government and beyond, corruption is rife. This only serves to weaken us, leaching wealth out of our nation. It does no good for image abroad either, with the wider perception of our nation across the world being negatively tainted by the knowledge of corruption, reducing investment and diplomatic opportunities. This image and the corruption that feeds it must be eradicated for the good of the nation and people. Trustworthy judges and civil servants will be hired to root out corruption, investigating government officials and firing and punishing those found to be guilty. New anti-corruption guidelines will make sure this cannot happen again."
 IRQ_Draft_Constitution:0 "Amend the Constitution"
 IRQ_Draft_Constitution_desc:0 "To pave the way for Iraq's modern future, the constitution must be amended to appropriate these new reforms. It will take many sleepless nights to work out all the loopholes and make everyone happy, but it must be done. A constitutional commission will be set out, to streamline and modernise the existing constitution, and to add new articles where necessary."
 IRQ_Controlled_Elections:0 "A New Election"
 IRQ_Controlled_Elections_desc:0 "Election day is here! The ballots are prepared, the people ready to decide their own future. Of course, the necessary precautions have been taken to make sure some of the more radical groups don't make headway, but a level of controlled democracy is sure to placate all but the most radical of dissidents."
 IRQ_Secret_Police:0 "Create the Secret Police"
 IRQ_Secret_Police_desc:0 "The nation needs a watchful eye looking over it which means a strong clandestine internal security organisation. Like a mother with her child, constant observation is necessary.

 IRQ_Control_Press:0 "Control the Press"
 IRQ_Control_Press_desc:0 "The press has become increasingly radical over the years, and more and more critical of our government. These newspapers and reporters must be "convinced" to change their headlines.

 IRQ_Stability_Through_Strength:0 "Stability through Strength"
 IRQ_Stability_Through_Strength_desc:0 "The monarch is the embodiment of a nation, an example for all to follow and respect. We must promote the monarchy as a personal symbol of the nation - strong, just and a unifying institution that all our people, regardless of background, can identify with. With this adoration of the monarchy will come strength, and a strong Iraq will survive and endure into the future."
 IRQ_Royal_Tour:0 "A Royal Tour"
 IRQ_Royal_Tour_desc:0 "For the British royal family, a royal tour of their empire, or parts of it, seems to have become an excellent means of promoting unity, by showing the monarch as in touch with their people. Following this example, a tour of our own royal family to the farthest reaches of Iraq will allow the people to take a peek into royal life - what we want them to see at least. It should hopefully bring the people close to their head of state and boost loyalty and unity."
 IRQ_Royal_Wedding:0 "A Royal Wedding"
 IRQ_Royal_Wedding_desc:0 "As the final centrepiece of the royal family's campaign to rebuild their popularity, organising a royal wedding is next on the agenda. A fitting Queen for King Faisal will be found, and a great, highly publicised wedding will be held as a patriotic occasion for all."
 IRQ_Sectarian_Issues:0 "Sectarian Issues"
 IRQ_Sectarian_Issues_desc:0 "Another result of Britain's creation of Iraq is our ongoing sectarian issues. Our nation is dominated by a Sunni minority, while the Shia majority grows increasingly bitter and hostile. Then there is Iraq's Kurdish population in the north, with some within it calling for autonomy or even independence. The situation is has been a thorn in the side of our nation for some time now. It must somehow be tackled."
 IRQ_Arab_Kurdish_Partnership:0 "Arab-Kurdish Partnership"
 IRQ_Arab_Kurdish_Partnership_desc:0 "Continuing to antagonize and alienate the Kurds will lead to irreparable damage in the relationships between the peoples of Iraq. Perhaps some compromise can be reached. For example, greater autonomy could be granted to Kurdish communities, as well as certain political and social freedoms, in order to turn the Kurds into loyal citizens of a diverse nation."
 IRQ_Healing_Sunni_Shia_Rift:0 "Healing the Sunni-Shia Rift"
 IRQ_Healing_Sunni_Shia_Rift_desc:0 "The Shia majority in Iraq feels it is an oppressed people, for the Sunni minority has long had disproportionate control of institutions of government. Through reconciliation and compromise, the widening rift must be healed. We will promote dialogue between the two religious groups, and hope to negotiate compromises on increasing Shia poliitcal representation, while not jeopardising the safety of the Sunni minority."
 IRQ_Suppress_Kurds:0 "Suppress the Kurds"
 IRQ_Suppress_Kurds_desc:0 "The Kurds have continued to destabilise our nation, we must teach them a lesson! We will curb Kurdish nationalist political action, and dedicate additional resources to policing Kurdish communities and curbing separatism.

IRQ_Iraqi_Armed_Forces_desc:0 "If we are to take our place as a great regional military power with the Arab world, and be able to defend our borders, we must build our armed forces from a relatively ragtag organisation barely able to defend our country, into a true fighting force. It is time to begin the wholesale modernisation of our armed forces."

# Navy
IRQ_The_Youngest_Force:0 "The Youngest Force"
IRQ_The_Youngest_Force_desc:0 "Founded only in 1937, the Iraqi navy is the youngest branch of our armed forces and generally the least prioritised. That does not mean that naval power has no uses for us however. As a country that relies on rivers and waterways into the Gulf, we must secure a minimum level of naval strength to maintain our interests and access to the sea."
IRQ_Coastal_Defence_Focus:0 "Coastal Defense"
IRQ_Coastal_Defence_Focus_desc:0 "Hemmed in as we are, we are not a nation with great naval ambitions in the near future, and control of the oceans is not realistically within our grasp. However, we must be able to defend our own coastlines and key waterways. Our naval strategy will be oriented towards that end."
IRQ_River_Boats:0 "River Boats"
IRQ_River_Boats_desc:0 "Ever since ancient times, Iraq is a nation on rivers - the great Tigris and Euphrates have served as the lifeblood of our civilisation for many thousands of years. In this modern era, we must be able to control our rivers should an invader attempt to seize them. A force of small armed river boats will be useful to this end."
IRQ_Coastal_Fortifications:0 "Basrah Fortifications"
IRQ_Coastal_Fortifications_desc:0 "The Basrah region, centred on the city of the same name, is strategically vital to us, serving as our access to the gulf and the broader seas. We must make sure this city and region are well-defended against any potential attack that would seek to seize this location and render us landlocked. Modern fortifications will be built in the region, better preparing it against any future amphibeous or ground-based attack."
IRQ_Gulf_Ambitions:0 "Gulf Ambitions"
IRQ_Gulf_Ambitions_desc:0 "The Gulf to our east is our only access to the oceans of the world, a small but strategically vital body of water. This chokehold leaves our country in a severely vulnerable position should we lose control of the Gulf to foreign powers, and while traditionally the British have dominated this sea, in the future we should be able to take its security into our own hands. We will work to build naval capabilities to control, or at least influence, the Gulf, so that the Persians or others cannot cut us off from the world by seizing total control of the sea."

IRQ_Found_Basra_Naval_Academy_desc:0 "As we dip our toes into naval capabilities and efforts, we must make sure we have a sufficient quantity of personnel to fill the necessary positions, something that we as yet have never had, being a nation unused to naval efforts. The new Basra Naval Academy in the coastal city of Basrah will fill this role, training our first true generation of naval personnel."
IRQ_Shipbuilding_Capabilities:0 "Shipbuilding Capabilities"
IRQ_Shipbuilding_Capabilities_desc:0 "With the early steps laid down in building a naval strategy and presence, it is time to truly begin preparations for achieving domestic naval capabilities.

IRQ_Modernising_the_Army_desc:0 "The army is the oldest and by far the largest branch of our armed forces, but unfortunately it is in a poor state. Old, obsolete and weak, it is not a force befitting of our country's ambitions. It is time to begin thoroughly modernising the army to turn it into a capable fighting force."
IRQ_Robertsons_Report:0 "Robertson's Report"
IRQ_Robertsons_Report_desc:0 "Prepared in 1951 by British army officer Brian Robertson, the infamous Robertson Report outlined the severe deficiencies of the Iraqi army, arguing it could do little to aid Britain's position in the Middle East at the time, and likely not even defend the country against an invading major power. Clearly, this is concerning to us, and we should read this report closely to learn about and deal with the deficiencies found."
IRQ_Improving_the_Officer_Corps:0 "Improving the Officer Corps"
IRQ_Improving_the_Officer_Corps_desc:0 "One of the key problems of our army so far is the quality of its leadership, at all levels from low level officers to the top of command. If this is to be improved, we need a larger number of better trained and qualified officers. Training programs will be expanded, to improve the skills of officers already in the army and train a new generation of officers, improving the army's leadership."
IRQ_Expand_Conscription:0 "Expand Conscription"
IRQ_Expand_Conscription_desc:0 "So far, our army has had the problem of simply being too small, traditionally relegated to internal duties under British oversight, and conscripting only a small proportion of the population. A true modern army needs significantly more mass, and so our greater recruitment needs must be met. The conscription law will be changed, bringing much more young men across the country into military service and swelling our ranks with the necessary recruits."
IRQ_Train_Shia_Officers:0 "Train Shia Officers"
IRQ_Train_Shia_Officers_desc:0 "Continuing to allow the Shia majority of our country to be locked out of the upper ranks of the army simply due to old sectarian dynamics is madness. If we are serious about building a meritocratic army, and massively expanding our talent pool of officers, we must begin allowing Shia Iraqis to rise up the ranks of the officer corps. No longer will the Sunnis be dominant in the army."
IRQ_Maintain_Sunni_Dominance:0 "Maintain Sunni Dominance"
IRQ_Maintain_Sunni_Dominance_desc:0 "While it is certain that we miss out on valuable talent by having Shia Iraqis locked out of the upper ranks of the army, a sudden shift away from this structure is simply too destabilising. The last thing we want at this important moment of reform, is to bring sectarian conflict into the upper ranks of the army and risk instability and internal conflict. For now, we will continue the policy of Sunni dominance within the officer corps, for the sake of ensuring stability and loyalty."
IRQ_Reform_Command_Structure:0 "Reform the Command Structure"
IRQ_Reform_Command_Structure_desc:0 "One of the key issues identified in Robinson's report was the problem of poor command at the core of the army, with the leadership of the army being described as conservative, uncooperative and inflexible. This is clearly an area in need of improvement - an army is only as good as those who lead it. To reduce the chance of conflict or confusion, and improve the smoothness of command, the command structure will be reformed and formalised, with the chain of command being made clear."
IRQ_Improve_Basic_Training:0 "Improve Basic Training"
IRQ_Improve_Basic_Training_desc:0 "An army, its strategy and its equipment are ultimately only as good as the fighting ability of the soldiers who carry it out and use it. At the moment, the quality of our soldiers is simply lacking compared to the greater military powers, which risks disorganisation or loss of morale in battle. To make sure our soldiers are able to fight as effectively as possible, basic training standards will be increased, with the help of foreign military advisors and experts."
IRQ_Army_Motorisation:0 "Army Motorisation"
IRQ_Army_Motorisation_desc:0 "The formation of a motorised brigade has long been an ambition of army planners, which would provide vital mobility in the vast, open lands of Iraq and its borders.

IRQ_A_Stronger_Base:0 "A Stronger Base"
IRQ_A_Stronger_Base_desc:0 "As we work to expand the size and strength of our army, we must make sure the basics are there. Internal logistics, basic weapons manufacturing and systems of mobilisation, training standards and command structures have already seen improvements that are bearing fruit.

IRQ_An_Iraqi_Way_of_War:0 "A New Arab Way of War"
IRQ_An_Iraqi_Way_of_War_desc:0 "While we have learned much from the greater military powers around the world, it has become clear to us that to fight effectively in these lands requires a unique way of war. The geography is unlike that of many places where modern wars have been fought, and we must innovate beyond what we can learn from simple copying. Our theorists, having learned from the greatest of what they could find abroad, are bringing together their lessons and local knowledge into a new doctrine, a new way of war suited for Iraq and the Arab world."
IRQ_Northern_Mountain_Forces:0 "Northern Mountain Forces"
IRQ_Northern_Mountain_Forces_desc:0 "The northern borderlands of our country have unique geography, being dominated by mountains. These strategic peaks guard our borders against possible incursions by Turkey or Iran, and are possible hiding places for Kurdish guerrillas. To maintain control of these mountain territories effectively, we must have forces able to fight in the highlands. Special training in mountaineering will be researched, to improve the fighting ability of our forces in this region."

IRQ_Desert_Warfare_Logistics_desc:0 "Away from the rivers, mountains and grasslands, vast deserts expand across some of our borderlands. We must make sure our forces are prepared to fight in this unforgiving terrain, despite the logistical challenges such remoteness provide.

IRQ_Armoured_Warfare:0 "Armoured Warfare"
IRQ_Armoured_Warfare_desc:0 "Recent wars in Europe showed the power that the tank, if properly utilised, can hold in smashing infantry formations and breaking through enemy lines. In the vast expanses of Iraq and its neighbouring regions, the importance of armoured warfare is even greater. However, to supply and command large numbers of tanks in the deserts or highlands will prove no easy feat without strong preparation. As we look into building armoured forces, we must prepare to use them as effectively as possible, by studying in and training for armoured warfare."

This was a fate unbefitting of the cradle of civilisation, of a land so important to world and Arab history. Now, however, with great military reforms underway and the vast expansion of our army, we are no longer a mere junior power, but a leading military force in the region. Despite what the Egyptians and others may claim, it is us Iraqis who lead the Arab world, with our army as its proud defenders!"

IRQ_A_Modern_Air_Force_desc:0 "Recent conflicts have shown that control of the skies is vital to winning any modern battle. If we are to be a country that can truly defend itself and its own interests, we must develop a modern air force, capable of defending our airspace and striking our enemies from above."
IRQ_Train_Pilots_and_Officers:0 "Train Pilots and Officers"
IRQ_Train_Pilots_and_Officers_desc:0 "The best hardware is nothing without the right personnel to use it. As we begin the program to expand our air force, we will set about increasing training of pilots, officers and other personnel, whose numbers in Iraq are currently lacking."
IRQ_Expand_Tikrit_Flying_School:0 "Expand Tikrit Flying School"
IRQ_Expand_Tikrit_Flying_School_desc:0 "The flying school at Tikrit serves as the primary training facility for our air force's pilots and is, for now, relatively small. As we seek to build a truly independent and powerful air force, we will need to drastically increase the quantity and quality of pilot training. With whatever help from abroad is necessary, we will expand this college and train more pilots."
IRQ_Expand_Habbaniya_Base:0 "Expand Habbaniya Base"
IRQ_Expand_Habbaniya_Base_desc:0 "Initially opened by the British in 1936, the Habbaniya air base around 90km west of Baghdad serves as the primary military air base in this country. It has served both the British and ourselves well, but if it is to host a modern air force, its facilities must be expanded. Necessary funding and resources will be put towards this, strengthening our air infrastructure at the base."
IRQ_Acquiring_Hardware:0 "Acquiring Hardware"
IRQ_Acquiring_Hardware_desc:0 "As well as skilled personnel, an air force requires aircraft, which is something we are unfortunately lacking. It is time to organise the aircraft we have, and expand our horizons by acquiring new models."
IRQ_Refurbish_Existing_British_Aircraft:0 "Refurbish Existing British Aircraft"
IRQ_Refurbish_Existing_British_Aircraft_desc:0 "During their military presence within our country, the British stationed a variety of aircraft, some of which have been left behind and essentially handed to us. Most of these are older, often obsolete models, and many are not even in working order, having been mothballed for some time. However, despite their age, they are still potentially useful, particularly against our regional enemies who may have just as poor air forces as us. We will set about collecting and refurbishing these old British airframes, which will form the base of our air force."
IRQ_Buy_New_Models:0 "Buy New Models"
IRQ_Buy_New_Models_desc:0 "For now, we do not have the domestic industrial and technological base to develop our own first-rate modern jets, but many are available on the global market from larger arms-producing nations. We will look to purchase our first modern aircraft, to form the tip of the spear of our air force."
IRQ_Controlling_Our_Skies:0 "Controlling Our Skies"
IRQ_Controlling_Our_Skies_desc:0 "In many ways the primary role of an air force is the defence of our own skies - should we lose control of our airspace, our enemy would be able to bomb our forces and our people from above with impunity. Ever effort must be made in training and strategy, coordinating with ground-based anti-air, to maintain air superiority over our home airspace and prevent such an occurance in any future conflict."
IRQ_Ground_Support_Missions:0 "Ground Support Missions"
IRQ_Ground_Support_Missions_desc:0 "As well as maintaining control of our home skies defensively, an air force also gives us the capability to support our ground forces on the offensive by attacking enemy forces on the ground, something the Germans showed with devastating effect across Europe. If we are to share in their success, we must begin looking into these methods. We will train our pilots to coordinate with ground forces, attacking enemy formations and allowing breakthroughs on the ground."
IRQ_Aerial_Reconnaissance:0 "Aerial Reconnaissance"
IRQ_Aerial_Reconnaissance_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the greatest advantages of having a presence in the air is the ability to observe the enemy from above their heads. In the vast deserts of our region, simply spotting enemy forces can be achieved effectively from the air and provide a great advantage in battle. We will invest in training and developing aerial reconnaissance techniques, improving our detection of enemy forces."

 IRQ_Unpopular_Monarchy_desc:0 "Now mostly seen as puppets of the British under the reign of Regent Abd al-Ilah, the Hashemite Monarchy has long lost its status as the leading voice for Arab unification.

 IRQ_oil_specialization: "Oil Specialization"
 IRQ_oil_specialization_desc: "Oil is our great resource, which provides our country with the promise of wealth.

 IRQ_maqal_oil_port: "Maqal Port"
 IRQ_maqal_oil_port_desc: "As we aim to grow our economy, particularly our capacity for exports, we need to improve our links to the outside world.

 IRQ_develop_iraqi_weapones: "Military Production"
 IRQ_develop_iraqi_weapones_desc: "The modern Middle East is a dangerous region, particularly as the power of Britain wanes and other jealous powers look greedily at our resources.

We will invest in kickstarting a domestic military industry, so we are not entirely reliant on imported weapons and can fight to defend ourselves in any eventuality."
 IRQ_invest_in_mining: "Invest in Mining"
 IRQ_invest_in_mining_desc: "Oil is not the only resource Iraq has at its disposal, with reserves of key minerals known but as yet not completely exploited.

 IRQ_encourage_tourism: "Encourge Tourism"
 IRQ_encourage_tourism_desc: "Iraq is a land with perhaps the oldest and among the greatest history and heritage of any nation in the world, and a land of beautiful geography and stunning culture. However, decades of economic backwardness and turmoil have left the country forgotten. In this world of increasing travel and wealth, tourism is a potentially lucrative new industry. We will invest in a budding tourist industry, aiming to take our rightful place among the most popular tourist destinations."
 IRQ_invite_foreign_investors: "Invite Investors"
 IRQ_invite_foreign_investors_desc: "If we are to achieve rapid economic development, we must do more than invest ourselves, but be able to attract foreign investment to help in the infrastructure projects we have planned.

 IRQ_Dual_State_desc: "We must put aside our internal politics and rivalries to focus on the our greater aim: Iraq, Syria, Jordan, the Saudis. All were drawn on a map by the British and French imperialists to prevent our destiny, of a united Arab World. Our western neighbour, Jordan, has extended interest in uniting our two nations, both to gain greater independence from the British and to combat the radical Syrian regime. We should make this union of two Hashemite monarchies a reality, as a first step toward the unification of the Arab peoples."
 IRQ_Connect_The_States: "Connect the States"
 IRQ_Connect_The_States_desc: "The Arabian desert has always been a harsh environment for all, and across history, traversing it has killed many a man. To truly unite Jordan and Iraq, a great infrastructure project has been proposed, involving the modernisation of infrastructure through this harsh terrain, particularly between the two former nations.

 IRQ_intergrate_syria: "Legacy of 1920"
 IRQ_intergrate_syria_desc: "Following the Great War, Prince Faisal I, who would later become the king of Iraq, ruled over Syria for a short time until the nation was conquered by the French.

 IRQ_to_make_faisal_proud_desc: "Since the days of the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans, the late Faisal I, our first king, dreamed of uniting the peoples of Arabia under one kingdom and nation, a dream that the British and French claimed to support but, in their greed, stole from us. Now, finally, the dream is on the way to being realised. The people of not just Iraq, but of all of Arabia, can celebrate the beginning of the restoration of their nation."

 IRQ_moderate_secularization: "Moderate Secularization"
 IRQ_moderate_secularization_desc: "While secularisation is a noble and necessary goal to modernise our society and nation, moving too quickly on here would bring social risks, and is surely to bring backlash among conservative groups within our society.

 IRQ_aristocratic_allies: "Call Upon Noble Allies"
 IRQ_aristocratic_allies_desc: "Our government can call upon numerous powerful and wealthy allies, from large rural landowning sheikhs to prestigious, rich urban families who rose through the social ranks during the Ottoman era. In this period of radical instability, these powerful figures are a valuable ally, and in return for some quiet 'favours', we can leverage their... underhanded support in favour of our government."

 IRQ_slight_shift: "A Kingdom of the 20th Century"
 IRQ_slight_shift_desc: "Our previous government was not evil, but was simply too conservative, too cautious to make the necessary reforms to keep our country on track.

 IRQ_modernize_education_system: "Moderate Education Reform"
 IRQ_modernize_education_system_desc: "Our education system is antiquated and backwards, but extreme changes could upset the balance of society, and risks intruding on and angering rural tribal communities, minorities and conservative groups.

It will not turn our people into modern citizens as quickly, but is as far as we dare push things for now."
 IRQ_moderate_secularization: "Moderate Secularization"
 IRQ_moderate_secularization_desc: "While the modernisation of society requires its secularisation, numerous conservative forces would resist a complete push against religion.

 POLITICS_NURI_SAID:0 "In the entire short history of the Iraqi Kingdom, many influential politicians have come and went - Yasin al-Hashimi and Hikmat Sulayman come to mind. But none of these compare to perhaps the single more important figure in Iraqi politics ever since the nation received its independence.\n\nNuri Pasha al-Said was born in 1888 to a rather unremarkable middle-class family living in Ottoman Baghdad. Al-Said graduated from Ottoman military college in 1906, partaking in numerous conflicts such as the Italo-Turkish war and the first World War.\n\nAfter being captured by the British in 1915, Al-Said would defect to the Allies' side, swearing loyalty to Emir Faisal of Hejaz and fighting in the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans, leading the Arab troops who took Damascus from the retreating Ottomans in 1918. Al-Said would fight for Faisal's doomed Syrian Kingdom but was eventually forced to follow Faisal to Iraq after the French invasion.\n\nA trusted ally of Faisal, al-Said would serve in numerous government positions, building up the Iraqi Army before finally being appointed Prime Minister for the first time in 1930. One of al-Said's first acts in office would be to sign the widely unpopular Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, effectively cementing Iraq's position as a British protectorate. Since then, al-Said has been widely regarded as a puppet to British interests, and while recent negotiations regarding Iraq's share in its vast resources have been met with optimism, the people are still tired.\n\nAl-Said has served as Prime Minister six times already, totaling twelve years of Iraq's thirty-year history. When will the time for change come?"

 POLITICS_QASIM:0 ""The Leader", as many call him, may claim to represent the will of the Iraqi people. On the surface, he has led a revolution against an unpopular monarch, liberating the people from the elites that rule them. Looking deeper, the truth is not so simple.\n\nBorn in 1914 to a family of farmers, Abd al-Karim Qasim's father died fighting in the first World War during Qasim's childhood. Growing up in Baghdad, Qasim entered the Iraqi Military College immediately after his graduation. It was during this time when Qasim was introduced to a "social club" of officers known as the Golden Square, which had secret plans to overthrow the British-aligned government and secure Iraq's independence with help from the Axis powers.\n\nDespite the Golden Square's planning, Germany's quick victories in France and the signing of the Anglo-German armistice foiled the group's plans, with many of its leading officers eventually resigning over the next decade.\n\nQasim would not give up so easily. Although his opinion of the monarchy was not extremely negative, he would eventually come to the conclusion that the only way to topple British influence in the country would be to take Faisal and the regent down with it. Over time, his influence and reputation would lead him to become the leader of the Golden Square, and when the new King failed to improve the disastrous situation that the Regent had created, Qasim decided it was time to strike.\n\nNow, Qasim is "The Leader", but for how long? He did not launch the coup alone - Fascists, Communists, and Ba'athists all swarm around him, vying for power. Qasim must watch his steps carefully."
